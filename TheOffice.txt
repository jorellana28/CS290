Jim Halpert: [Jim sits at his desk, dressed like Dwight] Question, what kind of bear is best?

Dwight Schrute: That's a ridiculous question.

Jim Halpert: False. Black bear.

Dwight Schrute: Well, that's debatable. There are basically two schools of thought.

Jim Halpert: Fact, bears eat beets. Bears, beets, "Battlestar Galactica."

Dwight Schrute: Bears do not... What is going on? What are you doing?

Jim Halpert: [in confessional] Last week, I was in a drugstore, and I saw these glasses. Four dollars. And it only cost me $7 to recreate the rest of the ensemble, and that is a grand total of $11.

Dwight Schrute: [Back at their desks] You know what? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. So I thank you.

[Jim takes a bobblehead doll out of his suitcase and sets it on his desk]

Dwight Schrute: Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year!

Jim Halpert: [imitating Dwight] Michael!

Dwight Schrute: Oh, that's funny. Michael!
